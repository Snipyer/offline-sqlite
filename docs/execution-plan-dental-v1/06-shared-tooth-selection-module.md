# Step 06 — Shared Tooth Selection Module

## Goal

Build reusable 3D tooth selection module that outputs validated FDI tooth IDs.

## Dependencies

- Step 01

## Checklist

- [x] Create isolated feature module for tooth selection.
- [x] Implement 2D FDI tooth selector (simplified from 3D for v1).
- [x] Support selecting/deselecting teeth with clear visual state.
- [x] Output structured FDI tooth IDs.
- [x] Enforce at least one tooth selected when required by consumer.
- [x] Expose simple, testable interface for form integration.
